Hi Brad :)

Html/css/javascript built with frameworks like Vue can not generally be opened regularly but instead have to be served over http in order to be viewed. I do not know how familiar you are with serving over http. But, to make it super easy for you I am hosting the outputted html/css to the below link so you can just go there to see it in browser.

================= How to find the code ========================

The code that makes the outputted index file can be best viewed at src/components/HelloWorld.vue

You can also go to /dist/index.html but thats the outputted/minified version and will be very hard to read.

================= Hard Way ========================

If you want to serve it yourself i suggest downloading Node. After you have done that you can go to your terminal. Enter the directory for the site and run:

npm install

and once thats done dowloading the modules:

npm run serve

Node can be found here:
